I recently built a Bank Transaction Dashboard using Excel and SQL, designed to analyze and visualize key financial insights from large-scale transaction data.

### Key Insights Covered:
✅ Most Common Payment Methods
✅ Transaction Trends by Month
✅ Top 10 Merchants by Transaction Amount
✅ Average Spending by Gender
✅ City-wise Average Income
✅ Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transactions
✅ Age Group Spending Patterns
✅ Average Income vs Average Balance by Occupation

### Tools & Techniques Used:

SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation (using joins, group by, case, and window functions)

Excel: Interactive dashboards with pivot charts, slicers, and data visualizations

Data Storytelling: Highlighted financial behaviors, fraud detection patterns, and demographic insights

### Outcome:
Delivered a two-page interactive dashboard for clear, data-driven decision-making on customer transactions and income analysis.
This project helped me strengthen my data analysis, SQL querying, and Excel dashboard design skills — turning raw data into actionable financial insights.
