Bank Transaction Analysis Dashboard

I recently built a Bank Transaction Dashboard using Excel and SQL, designed to analyze and visualize key financial insights from large-scale transaction data.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights Covered:
âœ… Most Common Payment Methods
âœ… Transaction Trends by Month
âœ… Top 10 Merchants by Transaction Amount
âœ… Average Spending by Gender
âœ… City-wise Average Income
âœ… Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transactions
âœ… Age Group Spending Patterns
âœ… Average Income vs Average Balance by Occupation

ðŸ§  Tools & Techniques Used:

SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation (using joins, group by, case, and window functions)

Excel: Interactive dashboards with pivot charts, slicers, and data visualizations

Data Storytelling: Highlighted financial behaviors, fraud detection patterns, and demographic insights

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:
Delivered a two-page interactive dashboard for clear, data-driven decision-making on customer transactions and income analysis.

ðŸ’¡ This project helped me strengthen my data analysis, SQL querying, and Excel dashboard design skills â€” turning raw data into actionable financial insights.
